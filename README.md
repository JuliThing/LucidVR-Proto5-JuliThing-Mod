# LucidVR-Proto5-JuliThing-Mod
First revision of my custom pcbs for the LucidVR Prototype 5 gloves.

This is a very rough first revision and may contain problems and design errors. I wouldn't recommend this revision for people who aren't knowlegable in pcbs and electronics.

Build at your own risk.

If you are still here and are willing to build or modify my design do post issues if you find them so I may fix them in future revisions.
